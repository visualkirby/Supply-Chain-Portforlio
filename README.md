In this presentation, we analyze the challenges and opportunities facing Medical Technologies Corporation (MTC), a leading medical device manufacturer, as it navigates the impact of the 2.3% medical device excise tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 

Key topics covered include:
- Financial Recovery: How MTC can address a $329.72 million shortfall caused by the tax and restore profitability.
- Logistics Optimization: Recommendations to bring sterilization in-house, partner with 3PLs, and improve inventory management.
- Demand Forecasting: Using the Holt-Winters method to improve accuracy and reduce errors in production and distribution.
- Strategic Positioning: Building strong partnerships with hospitals, delivering cost savings, and focusing on quality and patient outcomes.

We also explore the roles of key players in MTC’s supply chain, including hospital administrators, surgeons, distributors, and third-party logistics (3PL) firms, and how their decisions impact MTC’s operations.

This video provides actionable insights and recommendations to help MTC overcome its financial challenges, improve supply chain efficiency, and strengthen its position as a strategic supplier in the medical device industry.


Key Takeaways:
- The 2.3% medical device excise tax has significantly impacted MTC’s profitability, creating a need for cost savings and efficiency improvements.
- By optimizing logistics, improving demand forecasting, and building strong relationships with hospitals, MTC can offset the tax’s impact and improve its competitive position.
- Strategic initiatives like in-house sterilization, 3PL partnerships, and smart kiosks can streamline operations and reduce costs.
